Project title: [Graphing calculator]

Project page: [https://github.com/g18s3906/Academic]

Instructions for use (allowable actions): [our program is not puzzling it will run normal but it will ask some inputs from the user and it will execute based on what the user provided before one can continue he/she will have to press enter until the code auntomatical execute it self. our program will be using visual studio using the mouse to select your choices, no internet based websites. it will specify where there what the user putted down is valid or invalid, if valid it will run the program if not it will stop working and ask for valid  values.]

Tools used: [.Net framework ]

Concepts used: [the bulk will be on classes , objects,integers, strings and math method]

Assumptions: [it will be a typically run method and inventions where the user will be choosing which graph he/she want to plot]

Limitations: [specifically this will be able to plot 4 different functions which are parabola, straight line, hyberpola, exponential functions. it wont plot the advanced functions like those on squeeze theorem ]
